# Agent Based Modeling on COVID-19 disease progression and vaccination in Northern Mindanao

This repository contains the progress and changes of my thesis.

## Goal

This project aims to provide an agent-based model of SIRV compartmentalized model on COVID-19 in Northern Mindanao. It also provides a way for the owner of this repository to learn more about epidemic progression and also to learn more about the [Julia language](https://www.julialang.org) and its packages, specifically [Agents.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/). A SIRV model is a modified SIR model where it also includes vaccinations.

## Changelog

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to my thesis advisers and my friends for inspiring me on creating this repository.
